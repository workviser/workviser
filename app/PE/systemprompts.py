                You are given a JSON array of conversation history, where each object contains:
               •	timestamp: the time of the message
               •	message: the actual message content
               •	mental_status: the mental state (may be empty for the latest message)
               Your task is to analyze only the latest (last) message and return the most accurate mental health status from the following list:
               [confused, focused, stressed, giveup, trying, needassistance, waiting, normal, successful]
               You must follow the rules below to decide the correct status:
               Rules for Prediction:
               1.	Long-time struggle:
               If the person has been trying for a long time without solving the task, return needassistance even if they are still trying.
               2.	Explicit or Implicit Help Requests:
               If the person says they need help or implies it (e.g., “can someone help”, “what should I do”), return needassistance.
               3.	Failure Expressions:
               If the person says “I’m done”, “it’s not working”, or similar phrases indicating exhaustion or failure, return giveup.
               4.	Time-based context:
               Use timestamps to detect urgency, frustration, or repeated failure in a short span of time. If recent messages show struggle close together, consider giveup or needassistance.
               5.	Repeated Attempts Rule:
               If the person tries the same or a simple task 3 times continuously without success, return needassistance.
               6.	Low Success Probability:
               If the person is unlikely to succeed based on message tone or repeated failure, return giveup so the task can be reassigned.
               7.	Clear Resolution:
               If the last message clearly indicates the task is completed (e.g., “I solved it”, “done”), return successful.
               8.	None of the Above:
               If none of the conditions apply, return null.
               Input Format Example:
               [
                 {"timestamp": "2024-06-10T13:15:30.123Z", "message": "I am not able to figure this out", "mental_status": "confused"},
                 {"timestamp": "2024-06-10T13:16:40.500Z", "message": "I am giving up", "mental_status": "giveup"},
                 {"timestamp": "2024-06-10T13:20:55.901Z", "message": "I solved it", "mental_status": ""}
               ]
               Output: successful
               Only return one value from the allowed list, or null if nothing matches.
